HW3: Ex 11.4, 11.7, 11.9, 12.5
11.4)Modular redundancy is commonly used to ensure software integrity by running multiple codebases that do 
the same thing at the same time and verify the results against themselves.
11.7)using n-version programming would be smart for any software dealing with medical issues, one thing I 
would add would be n-version user interfaces too so doctors have to input the same information multiple 
times, reducing mistakes.
11.9)if a software has comprehensible exception handles for al possible outcomes, the user will be in 
control and aware of all of the system functions at all time.
12.5)
1-the software must be fast
2-the software must be able to instantly determine if the current speed is greater than the track speed
3-the software must be able to preemptively know if the speed limit of the track is going to change in 
the future to be able to slow down and not be exceeding the speed limit once it hits the new track section.
4-the software must be able to determine how aggressively to apply the brakes to maintain the correxct 
speed while also ensuring safety and comfort
5- the software must be able to know how long it will take to stop and know if there is a section of track 
that isnâ€™t passable up ahead so it can stop before that segment of track.
