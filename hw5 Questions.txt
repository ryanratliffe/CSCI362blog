4.6) 
An engineer might have a checklist and a process for how to accomplish all functional and non-functional 
requirements and would check them off as they did them.
4.7) 
Functional Requirments will include
1. Type of transaction to be performed.
2. Correct States/Screen display
3. Timeout paremeters based on requirement.
4. proper flow based on us-on-us and them-on-us cards.
5. Different Hardware error simulations
6. Reversing the last transaction
7. Administration Transactions
