In software the primary concern of the developer should be the security and integrity of all the data 
coming into or leaving the program. A developer should go about doing this via extensive test-driven 
development, so many modern software has numerous vulnerabilities to the point where login credentials 
might as well not be used, and data is expected to not be private. In critical roles of software like 
banking the government has tried to create regulations to ensure privacy for the public but isn’t super 
effective since most banks have extraordinary legal shields for problems like this. For applications 
like wireless systems in cars there are extreme concerns of the security, namely for one’s safety and 
defense against people with mal intent and the ability to hack into a car and confuse the Systems 
sensors to cause a crash or even change the destination of the vehicle to virtually abduct passengers. 
The modularization of components in the car and extreme testing is required to ensure the safety of 
everyone and anyone who drives including the passengers in the car. The general takeaway from these 
issues is that extreme amounts of testing ensures the satisfaction and of the customer in any significant 
kind of software.
